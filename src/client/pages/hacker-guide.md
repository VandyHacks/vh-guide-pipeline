# <a name="what-is-a-virtual-hackathon"></a>What is a Virtual Hackathon?

A hackathon is a sprint of innovation. The purpose is to meet new friends, learn new skills, and connect with potential employers. This still holds true whether it’s your first or 50th hackathon, whether it's online or in person. You will have 36 hours to complete a project. We've worked hard to make everything as close to an in person hackathon as possible-- there will be workshops for hackers of all levels, mini events, mentors on demand, expert judges, and prizes!

# <a name="finding-a-team"></a>Finding a Team

There are a couple of ways to find a team. You can join our [Team Matching Group on Facebook](_____), and you can post to see if anyone wants to work on your idea with you. If you don’t have an idea, that’s OK too! Just post and say your background, any languages or technical experience you have, and say you’re looking for a team. Remember that everyone is in the same boat – don’t be afraid to put yourself out there!

We will also be providing a Discord channel (#team-matching) to help facilitate team creation or you can attend the team finding session right after the opening ceremony.

# <a name="getting-help"></a>Getting Help

-   Ask in the Help category in the sidebar.
