# <a name="what-is-a-hackathon"></a>What is a Hackathon?

A hackathon is a sprint of innovation. The purpose is to meet new friends, learn new skills, and connect with potential employers. This still holds true whether it’s your first or 50th hackathon. If you’ve never done a hackathon before, you’re in for a treat. Never made your own website before? Check out our Web Dev beginner workshop track! Always wanted to create a virtual reality game? Stop by our hardware lab and get started! We’ve provided you with free food, travel, hardware, and mentors – everything you need to have an amazing weekend.

# <a name="what-to-bring"></a>What to Bring

We’ll have two sleeping rooms (434 and 462) with sleeping bags and mats, so bring a pillow! We also have showers available at our venue to use on Saturday, so make sure you have a towel and any shower supplies. If you want to rent any hardware, a government-issued ID is required, no exceptions. Please do not bring weapons, drugs, or alcohol. If you’re not sure, please ask us ahead of time!

-   **Student ID** (required) + government ID
-   **Water bottle**
-   Laptop and Phone
-   Chargers
-   Extra clothes (bring lots of layers!)
-   Pillow
-   Toiletries (shampoo, toothbrush + toothpaste, deodorant, towel, shower shoes)

# <a name="how-to-prepare"></a>How to Prepare

-   Read this guide completely. Make sure you understand the schedule and venue. You don’t want any logistics to distract you while you’re “in the zone” this weekend, so get all of your the questions out of the way beforehand!

-   Join the VandyHacks Facebook event [here](https://www.facebook.com/events/1000805890262918/). Use this event page to share ideas, ask for help, team up for adventures, and meet new friends. The event page is here.

-   Join our Slack at [slack.vandyhacks.org](https://slack.vandyhacks.org). We’ll be using Slack for important announcements, live updates, and connecting you with our technical mentors. This is also a great space to chat with other hackers!

-   Look at previous projects. All of the projects from VandyHacks I, II, III, IV, and V can be found here: [VHI](https://vandyhacks.devpost.com/submissions), [VHII](https://vandyhacks2.devpost.com/submissions), [VHIII](https://vandyhacks3.devpost.com/submissions), [VHIV](https://vandyhacksiv.devpost.com/submissions), and [VHV](https://vandyhacksv.devpost.com/submissions).

-   Get your homework done. This may sound silly, but double-check that you have all of your work done for Monday. You’ll be exhausted, so make sure to do it before or earlier in the weekend.

# <a name="finding-a-team"></a>Finding a Team

There are a couple of ways to find a team. You can join our [Team Matching Group on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/723097038207924), and you can post to see if anyone wants to work on your idea with you. If you don’t have an idea, that’s OK too! Just post and say your background, any languages or technical experience you have, and say you’re looking for a team. Remember that everyone is in the same boat – don’t be afraid to put yourself out there!

We will also be providing a Slack channel (#teamfinding) to help facilitate team creation or you can attend the team finding session right after the opening ceremony.

# <a name="getting-help"></a>Getting Help

## Introduction

-   This year, we have a Slackbot to help manage mentorship requests! It will live in [#help](https://app.slack.com/client/TPLEGCPGD/CPTME0AJU) and in DMs. Once you send a request, it will be sent a mentor who can claim your request.
    ![Hacker Welcome Message](./images/mentorbot_hacker_welcome.png)
-   The bot will automatically put you and your paired mentor in a DM channel for any further discussion.
    ![DM Channel](./images/dm_example.png)

## Getting set up

-   You can select "Direct Messages" in Slack, then [DM the Mentorship Slackbot](https://app.slack.com/client/TPLEGCPGD/DPW0DHSDU). The bot will ping you if you need help.
-   Click the I need a mentor button. A form will pop up, as shown below.

## Final Notes

-   If you have any other questions, reach out to an organizer. Happy hacking!
    This year, we're implementing a help queue to help hackers find help.

# <a name="wifi-electronics-hardware"></a>Wifi, Electronics, & Hardware

You can use the "vuGuest" or "eduroam" WiFi.
You can also use the alternate WiFi by connecting to the network “vummiv”. Note that this is a hidden network, so you'll have to manually enter in the SSID. If you’re having trouble, check out [Vanderbilt's IT site](https://it.vanderbilt.edu/services/network/wireless/vu-guests.php) for troubleshooting. We will also have power strips and ethernet cords available at our hardware desk for checkout. Ethernet ports will be active on the second floor.

A list of available hardware can be found [here](https://hardware.mlh.io).

# <a name="sleeping-eating-showering"></a>Sleeping, Eating, & Showering

We will have sleeping rooms (434 for females, 462 for males) on the fourth floor of the building with sleeping bags, so bring along a pillow!

Free food and drink will be provided. If you have any dietary restrictions, please confirm with an organizer or volunteer before getting meals. Those with dietary restrictions will eat first, so please be there early if you need special accommodation.

Showers will be provided at our venue on Saturday afternoon on each floor. Signup sheets will be posted on the doors. Shampoo and body wash will be provided inside each shower. Shower times will be limited to 15 minutes.

# <a name="opening-ceremony"></a>Opening Ceremony

Opening ceremony will be held at [Langford Auditorium](https://goo.gl/maps/JXk7dR27UZ22). You’ll hear from our sponsors and get all of the logistics for the weekend. We’ll cover what a hackathon is, how to get the most out of your weekend, prizes, mentors, and hardware. By the end of the opening ceremony, you’ll have everything you need to get hacking!

# <a name="closing-ceremony"></a>Closing Ceremony

Closing ceremony will be held in the [Student Life Center](https://goo.gl/maps/UcyMJyN4VDF2). The top five teams will present their projects at this time, and all prizes will be awarded. Buses will leave immediately following the ceremony.

# <a name="prizes"></a>Prizes

The complete list of prizes will be announced at the Opening Ceremony. Stay tuned for some amazing surprises!

-   **Major League Hacking Prizes** - [hack.mlh.io/prizes](https://hack.mlh.io/prizes/)

# <a name="submitting-your-project"></a>Submitting Your Project

You have a project, mock up, slide deck, demo, anything! You will be submitting hard work online via [Devpost](https://vandyhacksvi.devpost.com). All submissions are due by 9AM on Sunday, so be aware of the time because you will not be allowed to submit afterwards. You will be asked to write a title and short description for your project, along with what prizes your project is eligible to win. Remember, this is something you can show off to recruiters, family, and friends in the future!

# <a name="presenting-your-project"></a>Presenting Your Project

After everyone has submitted their project, you will get a chance to present yours during the expo round! The expo will take place in the Wond’ry starting at 10:00 AM on Sunday. Your team will be assigned a table number, so make sure you get to your table early so that you can smooth out any technical difficulties. We’ll have power strips ready for you, but be sure to have a demo and your pitch planned out. If you’re not sure how to demo, don’t worry! We’ll be hosting a "How To Demo" talk from 9-10 AM Sunday teaching you how to present your project to judges and other hackers.

In order to encourage people to check out other teams’ projects, we require that only one team member be at the table each time. Walk around, check out other projects, and ask them questions! Plan with your team how you want to rotate shifts. If your presentation absolutely needs more than one member at a time, please talk to an organizer first.

During the expo, judges will be walking around to score your project. This is when they will pick the prize category winners for the weekend (and winners of our sponsor categories), so be friendly, have a demo ready, and be prepared to answer any questions they ask you!

# <a name="buses"></a>Buses

If you have any questions, email us at [travel@vandyhacks.org](mailto:travel@vandyhacks.org).

# <a name="reimbursements"></a>Reimbursements

Getting travel reimbursement consists of filling in and submitting the vendor approval forms before the start of the event (aka 5:30pm CST November 1st) so that Vanderbilt can direct deposit the money after the event. You will be required to show us the receipt during the event.
For the travel back you have to send in your receipts to travel@vandyhacks.org within one week of VH (by November 10th 11:59pm) along with your name and email used for your application.

Instructions for W-9 form: You must print this form and fill it out because the signature must be by hand to be valid. On page 1 fill out fields 1, 3 (Individual), 5, 6, Part I (Taxpayer ID Number) with your social security number, Part II (Certification) with your signature and the date.
Redcap is a secure web application (HIPAA certified) and only two board members will have access to the forms before they are handed over to Vanderbilt's administration. If you would prefer not to enter your SSN you can fill out and upload the rest and then email travel@vandyhacks.org to set up a time to call the person in charge of travel reimbursements so that they can write in your SSN at our end.

Instructions for ACH form: You must print this form and fill it out because the signature must be by hand to be valid. In place of the EFT/EDI contact and A/R contact you simply fill in your details once again. This form is tailored to businesses, hence the repetition. You can find your ACH routing# in your checkbook.

Please email travel@vandyhacks.org with any questions!

A colossal fruit loop I may bring to mind,<br>
and behind me, the first clue to the hunt will you find._
