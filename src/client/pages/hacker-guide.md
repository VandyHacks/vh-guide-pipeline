# <a name="what-is-a-hackathon"></a>What is a Virtual Hackathon?

A hackathon is a sprint of innovation. The purpose is to meet new friends, learn new skills, and connect with potential employers. This still holds true whether it’s your first or 50th hackathon, whether it's online or in person. You will have 36 hours (or more, depending on if you choose to take on a non profit's project challenge) to complete a project. We've worked hard to make everything as close to an in person hackathon as possible-- there will be workshops for hackers of all levels, mini events, mentors on demand, and prizes!

# <a name="what-to-bring"></a>What to Have on Hand

If you'd like to participate in baking lemon bars, one of our mini events, please ensure that you have these 5 ingredients:

-   1/2 cup butter
-   1.5 cup white sugar
-   4 tbsp all purpose flour
-   2 eggs
-   1 lemon

# <a name="how-to-prepare"></a>How to Prepare

-   Read this guide completely. Make sure you go over the schedule and hop on the Discord. The Discord will be our main mode of communication, so make sure you're checking it!

-   Join our Discord [here](https://discord.gg/gJaYFas). We’ll be using Discord for important announcements, live updates, mini event coordination, connecting with non profit orgs, and connecting you with our technical mentors. This is also a great space to chat with other hackers!

-   Join the VandyHacks Facebook event [here](https://facebook.com/events/s/vandyhacks-summer-edition/2701703253481744/?ti=icl). Use this event page to share ideas, ask for help, team up for adventures, and meet new friends.

-   Look at previous projects. All of the projects from VandyHacks I, II, III, IV, and V can be found here: [VHI](https://vandyhacks.devpost.com/submissions), [VHII](https://vandyhacks2.devpost.com/submissions), [VHIII](https://vandyhacks3.devpost.com/submissions), [VHIV](https://vandyhacksiv.devpost.com/submissions), [VHV](https://vandyhacksv.devpost.com/submissions), and [VHVI](https://vandyhacksvi.devpost.com/submissions).

# <a name="finding-a-team"></a>Finding a Team

There are a couple of ways to find a team. You can join our [Team Matching Group on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/723097038207924), and you can post to see if anyone wants to work on your idea with you. If you don’t have an idea, that’s OK too! Just post and say your background, any languages or technical experience you have, and say you’re looking for a team. Remember that everyone is in the same boat – don’t be afraid to put yourself out there!

We will also be providing a Discord channel (#teamfinding) to help facilitate team creation or you can attend the team finding session right after the opening ceremony.

# <a name="non-profits" id="non-profits"></a>Hack-for-Good Non-profit Externships

VandyHacks helps developers and non-profits collaborate in the form of an externship to solve non-profit’s problem. Externship would be an excellent summer opportunity to build a meaningful project that would benefit the community. Hackers will start working on projects during the hackathon and will be judged on progress made on one of the projects during the weekend. After the hackathon, hackers will be working on completing the project to the production level for chosen non-profit. This year, we are partnering with the following non-profit organizations to match chosen hackers with real-life projects:

<hr/>

## Nashville Entrepreneurship Center

Nashville Entrepreneurship Center is a non-profit, working towards building a robust entrepreneurial network in Nashville. The project they need help with is building a centralized database of resources in Nashville and an automated recommendation system for local start-ups.

## Nashville Public Library Foundation

The Nashville Public Library Foundation raises funds for the local public library system in order to ensure equitable literacy for all. Their project involves building a user-friendly data visualization tool and dashboard that allows them to better track their online engagement metrics.

## The Next Door

The Next Door offers a safe place for women to receive treatment for drug and alcohol abuse. Their project involves building a new event-tracking software such that they can better track information about their volunteer and sponsor networks.

## Hands-On Nashville

Hands on Nashville connects volunteers to opportunities supporting 100+ nonprofits, schools, and other civic organizations. They are looking to build a platform to easily communicate with and manage volunteers and track attendance of their events.

## Sexual Assault Center

The Sexual Assault Center is dedicated to providing healing for children, adults, and families affected by sexual assault. They are looking for 1) a dashboard application for entering and compiling data and 2) a mobile app for appointment check-ins and paperwork.

## Water Walkers

Water Walkers aims to bring hope to Nashville’s inner-city through watersports and education. Their project is a web-based solution to tracking attendance and storing and quickly accessing student information.

<hr/>

An externship with a non-profit is a great chance to get professional experience of solving a problem of an organization and developing a fully functional solution. By directly communicating with the end user (the non-profit), you will enhance your skills of understanding the problem and finding creative ways to tackle it. The software you will develop and the collaboration with the non-profit will be great things to add into your portfolio and resume. With all of this, your work significantly benefits the community!

If you are interested in proceeding with a non-profit project and an externship matching process, please fully read this [documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13WCPxi8P0_-wx7Cuo60SUuLI1GTgyR2rY379GzL583A/edit?usp=sharing), gather a team, and submit an [application](https://forms.gle/UKaQ2hZdiM756XW99). We will provide a detailed description of each project to chosen hackers, as well as have a video-conference with non-profit representatives.

# <a name="getting-help"></a>Getting Help

## Introduction

-   This year, we have a Discord bot to help manage mentorship requests! It will live in #mentors and in DMs. Once you send a request, it will be sent a mentor who can claim your request.

-   The bot will automatically put you and your paired mentor in a DM channel for any further discussion.
