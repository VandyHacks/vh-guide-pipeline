What is a Virtual Hackathon?
A hackathon is a sprint of innovation. The purpose is to meet new friends, learn new skills, and connect with potential employers. This still holds true whether it’s your first or 50th hackathon, whether it's online or in person. You will have 36 hours (or more, depending on if you choose to take on a non profit's project challenge) to complete a project. We've worked hard to make everything as close to an in person hackathon as possible-- there will be workshops for hackers of all levels, mini events, mentors on demand, and prizes!

What to Have on Hand
If you'd like to participate in baking lemon bars, one of our mini events, please ensure that you have these 5 ingredients:

1/2 cup butter
1.5 cup white sugar
4 tbsp all purpose flour
2 eggs
1 lemon
How to Prepare
Read this guide completely. Make sure you go over the schedule and hop on the Discord. The Discord will be our main mode of communication, so make sure you're checking it!

Join our Discord here. We’ll be using Discord for important announcements, live updates, mini event coordination, connecting with non profit orgs, and connecting you with our technical mentors. This is also a great space to chat with other hackers!

Join the VandyHacks Facebook event here. Use this event page to share ideas, ask for help, team up for adventures, and meet new friends. The event page is here.

Look at previous projects. All of the projects from VandyHacks I, II, III, IV, and V can be found here: VHI, VHII, VHIII, VHIV, and VHV.

Finding a Team
There are a couple of ways to find a team. You can join our Team Matching Group on Facebook, and you can post to see if anyone wants to work on your idea with you. If you don’t have an idea, that’s OK too! Just post and say your background, any languages or technical experience you have, and say you’re looking for a team. Remember that everyone is in the same boat – don’t be afraid to put yourself out there!

We will also be providing a Discord channel (#teamfinding) to help facilitate team creation or you can attend the team finding session right after the opening ceremony.

Getting Help
Introduction
This year, we have a Discord bot to help manage mentorship requests! It will live in #mentors and in DMs. Once you send a request, it will be sent a mentor who can claim your request. Hacker Welcome Message
The bot will automatically put you and your paired mentor in a DM channel for any further discussion. DM Channel
Getting set up
You can select "Direct Messages" in Discord, then DM the Mentorship Discord bot. The bot will ping you if you need help.
Click the I need a mentor button. A form will pop up, as shown below. Hacker Welcome Mentor Form
Final Notes
If you have any other questions, PM an organizer (we will have organizer tages in our profile names). Happy hacking!
Opening Ceremony
Opening ceremony will be streamed on Twitch at 7:45 PM CT on July 10th. We will give a quick welcome to hackers and an overview of this weekend.

Closing Ceremony
Closing ceremony will be streamed on Twitch at 10:30 AM CT. The presentations of the top teams' projects will be played at this time.

Submitting Your Project
Please create no more than a 1.5 minute video explaining and/or demonstrating your project. This can be done in any way - through slides, talking, showing the code/interface. Please make sure that judges will be able to throughly understand your project, as you will no have the opportunity to answer questions.

You will be submitting your video online via Devpost. All submissions are due by 8AM on Sunday, so be aware of the time because you will not be allowed to submit afterwards. You will be asked to write a title and short description for your project. Remember, this is something you can show off to recruiters, family, and friends in the future!
