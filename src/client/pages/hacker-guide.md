# <a name="what-is-a-hackathon"></a>What is a Hackathon?

A hackathon is a sprint of innovation. The purpose is to meet new friends, learn new skills, and connect with potential employers. This still holds true whether it’s your first or 50th hackathon. If you’ve never done a hackathon before, you’re in for a treat. Never made your own website before? Check out our Web Dev beginner workshop track! Always wanted to create a virtual reality game? Stop by our hardware lab and get started! We’ve provided you with free food, travel, hardware, and mentors – everything you need to have an amazing weekend.

# <a name="what-to-bring"></a>What to Bring

We’ll have a sleeping room (434) with sleeping bags and mats, so bring a pillow! We also have showers available at our venue to use on Saturday, so make sure you have a towel and any shower supplies. If you want to rent any hardware, a government-issued ID is required, no exceptions. Please do not bring weapons, drugs, or alcohol. If you’re not sure, please ask us ahead of time!

- **Student ID** (required) + government ID
- **Water bottle**
- Laptop and Phone
- Chargers
- Extra clothes (bring lots of layers!)
- Pillow
- Toiletries (shampoo, toothbrush + toothpaste, deodorant, towel, shower shoes)

# <a name="how-to-prepare"></a>How to Prepare

- Read this guide completely. Make sure you understand the schedule and venue. You don’t want any logistics to distract you while you’re “in the zone” this weekend, so get all of your the questions out of the way beforehand!

- Join the VandyHacks Facebook event [here](https://www.facebook.com/events/1000805890262918/). Use this event page to share ideas, ask for help, team up for adventures, and meet new friends. The event page is here.

- Join our Slack at [slack.vandyhacks.org](https://vandyhacksvi.slack.com). We’ll be using Slack for important announcements, live updates, and connecting you with our technical mentors. This is also a great space to chat with other hackers!

- Look at previous projects. All of the projects from VandyHacks I, II, III, IV, and V can be found here: [VHI](https://vandyhacks.devpost.com/submissions), [VHII](https://vandyhacks2.devpost.com/submissions), [VHIII](https://vandyhacks3.devpost.com/submissions), [VHIV](https://vandyhacksiv.devpost.com/submissions), and [VHV](https://vandyhacksv.devpost.com/submissions).

- Get your homework done. This may sound silly, but double-check that you have all of your work done for Monday. You’ll be exhausted, so make sure to do it before or earlier in the weekend.

# <a name="finding-a-team"></a>Finding a Team

There are a couple of ways to find a team. If you join our Facebook event, listed above, you can post to see if anyone wants to work on your idea with you. If you don’t have an idea, that’s OK too! Just post and say your background, any languages or technical experience you have, and say you’re looking for a team. Remember that everyone is in the same boat – don’t be afraid to put yourself out there!

We will be providing a Slack channel (#teamfinding) and a Facebook [group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/723097038207924/members/?notif_id=1572121836380496&notif_t=groups_member_joined&__xts__[0]=68.ARA0ClGIVFSjpb9_WWPg1_4WpZLag3XH6DRTX5NyogwlBt4Uxg2whxc-qVRI_kHpugt-ZMREa8StBM0-O5KaNQZ6RVEgqut7umc8P527Uu5h1bP_yybDMkl_RhnveudhI0-O07gghPQcQCvi2DOsjQ3PyoQr2LI8pJoYKoduvcu3hPbN-fJ4BSNqXg3smRkm7lOGXax4N0IY4tJXkNvP4AIHxYC2RjYj5_AziNoYU9rrDDKK6fe1tRb1ceACFWXVhwvFLYo0tvTFycbfl4_c3uV2cwyfUaV-w0rxRixGzoQIY0rcsk-iUCU95iKCSNDxwSRV&__tn__=-UK-R) to help facilitate team creation. There will also be a meetup session right after the opening ceremony.

# <a name="getting-help"></a>Getting Help

This year, we're implementing a help queue to help hackers find help. At the event, you'll be able to login to the help queue at [help.vandyhacks.org](https://help.vandyhacks.org). Your username is your email, with the `@` replaced with `-`, and your password is `default` followed by the first letter of your name.
(For example, if your name is `Bob Smith` with an email of `bob@school.edu`, your username would be `bob-school.edu` and your password would be `defaultb`). We understand this may be a bit unusual, but please bear with us. This will let you reach out to mentors for help!

You can request a mentor anytime by submitting a help ticket. Then, just wait for an available mentor to show up or contact you! Please note that you can only have one active ticket at a time. You may also cancel your ticket if you no longer need help.

# <a name="wifi-electronics-&-hardware"></a>Wifi, Electronics, & Hardware

You can use our WiFi by connecting to the network “vummiv”. Note that this is a hidden network, so you'll have to manually enter in the SSID. If you’re having trouble, check out [Vanderbilt's IT site](https://it.vanderbilt.edu/services/network/wireless/vu-guests.php) for troubleshooting. We will also have power strips and ethernet cords available at our hardware desk for checkout. Ethernet ports will be active on the second floor.

A list of available hardware can be found [here](https://hardware.mlh.io).

# <a name="sleeping-eating-&-showering"></a>Sleeping, Eating, & Showering

We will have a sleeping room (434) on the fourth floor of the building with sleeping bags, so bring a pillow!

Free food and drink will be provided. If you have any dietary restrictions, please confirm with an organizer or volunteer before getting meals. Those with dietary restrictions will eat first, so please be there early if you need special accommodation.

Showers will be provided at our venue on Saturday afternoon on each floor. Signup sheets will be posted on the doors. Shampoo and body wash will be provided inside each shower. Shower times will be limited to 15 minutes.

# <a name="composting"></a>Composting

This year, we're super excited to have composting available! Keep an eye out for signs indicating which items can and can't be composted.

Please make sure to place the following items into compost bins:

- Food scraps/leftovers
- Plates, napkins, bowls, and cutlery

Please DO NOT place the following items into compost bins:

- Recyclable materials (these go in recycle bins!)

# <a name="opening-ceremony"></a>Opening Ceremony

Opening ceremony will be held at [Langford Auditorium](https://goo.gl/maps/JXk7dR27UZ22). You’ll hear from our sponsors and get all of the logistics for the weekend.

# <a name="submitting-your-project"></a>Submitting Your Project

You have a project, mock up, slide deck, demo, anything! You will be submitting hard work online via [Devpost](https://vandyhacksv.devpost.com). All submissions are due by 9AM on Sunday, so be aware of the time because you will not be allowed to submit afterwards. You will be asked to write a title and short description for your project, along with what prizes your project is eligible to win. Remember, this is something you can show off to recruiters, family, and friends in the future!

# <a name="presenting-your-project"></a>Presenting Your Project

After everyone has submitted their project, you will get a chance to present yours during the expo round! The expo will take place in the Wond’ry starting at 10:00 AM on Sunday. Your team will be assigned a table number, so make sure you get to your table early so that you can smooth out any technical difficulties. We’ll have power strips ready for you, but be sure to have a demo and your pitch planned out. If you’re not sure how to demo, don’t worry! We’ll be hosting a "How To Demo" talk from 9-10 AM Sunday teaching you how to present your project to judges and other hackers.

In order to encourage people to check out other teams’ projects, we require that only one team member be at the table each time. Walk around, check out other projects, and ask them questions! Plan with your team how you want to rotate shifts. If your presentation absolutely needs more than one member at a time, please talk to an organizer first.

During the expo, judges will be walking around to score your project. This is when they will pick the prize category winners for the weekend (and winners of our sponsor categories), so be friendly, have a demo ready, and be prepared to answer any questions they ask you!
