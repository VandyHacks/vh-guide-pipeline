# <a name="what-is-a-hackathon"></a>What is a Virtual Hackathon?

A hackathon is a sprint of innovation. The purpose is to meet new friends, learn new skills, and connect with potential employers. This still holds true whether it’s your first or 50th hackathon, whether it's online or in person. You will have 36 hours to complete a project. We've worked hard to make everything as close to an in person hackathon as possible-- there will be workshops for hackers of all levels, mini events, mentors on demand, expert judges, and prizes!

-   Join our Discord [here](https://discord.gg/VDQGkBq). We’ll be using Discord for important announcements, live updates, mini event coordination, connecting with non profit orgs, and connecting you with our technical mentors. This is also a great space to chat with other hackers!

# <a name="finding-a-team"></a>Finding a Team

There are a couple of ways to find a team. You can join our [Team Matching Group on Facebook](_____), and you can post to see if anyone wants to work on your idea with you. If you don’t have an idea, that’s OK too! Just post and say your background, any languages or technical experience you have, and say you’re looking for a team. Remember that everyone is in the same boat – don’t be afraid to put yourself out there!

We will also be providing a Discord channel (#team-matching) to help facilitate team creation or you can attend the team finding session right after the opening ceremony.

# <a name="getting-help"></a>Getting Help

## Introduction

-   This year, we have a Discord bot to help manage mentorship requests! It will live in `#mentors`. Once you send a request, it will be sent all mentors who can view and choose to claim the request. If you ever need a rundown of the bot's commands, type `!help`.
    ![Mentorship Bot Commands](./images/ticket_commands.png)

## Getting set up

-   You can select `#mentors` in Discord and ping the Mentorship Discord bot.
-   Type `!new` and summarize your issue, and the bot will automatically create a private channel for it. Any mentor can enter this channel for further discussion.
    ![Summarizing issue](./images/ticket_creation.png)
    ![Individual channel](./images/hacker_individual_ticket_channel.png)
- <ins>Important Note:</ins> Once you and a mentor have resolved an issue, the mentor will use the `!close` command to resolve the issue. To prevent server spam, <ins>closing an issue deletes all records of the request channel</ins>. We highly suggest you take a screenshot or copy any relevant information you might need for later.

## Final Notes

-   If you have any other questions, PM an organizer (we will have organizer tages in our profile names). Happy hacking!

# <a name="submitting-your-project"></a>Submitting Your Project

Please create no more than a 1.5 minute video explaining and/or demonstrating your project. This can be done in any way - through slides, talking, showing the code/interface. Please make sure that judges will be able to throughly understand your project, as you will no have the opportunity to answer questions unless you are picked to demo during the closing ceremony. Only the top 4 submissions are picked to demo. 

You will be submitting your video online via [Devpost](https://vandyhacks-retro-edn.devpost.com/). All submissions are due by 9:30 AM CST on Sunday, so be aware of the time because you will not be allowed to submit afterwards. You will be asked to write a title and short description for your project. Remember, this is something you can show off to recruiters, family, and friends in the future!
