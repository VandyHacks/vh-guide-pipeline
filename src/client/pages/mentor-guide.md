## tl;dr

First of all, thank you so much for dedicating your time to being a mentor! We want to ensure that our hackers get the best possible experience to create something amazing. Here are a few key points:

- Join our Slack [here](https://vandyhacksvi.slack.com). All announcements will be made here, and you'll be connecting with students who may need help in the #help channel. Contact Alex Cuc on Slack to be added to the #mentors private channel.

- Have fun! For many of our hackers, this is their first introduction to the hacking culture, and if you’re having a blast, so will they! If there’s anything we can do for you or them, feel free to reach out on the #mentor slack channel, or find an organizer.

- In case of an emergency, please contact an organizer immediately. Emergency information can be found at the end of this document.

- We've got a special gift for you, so reach out to Alec Cuc before you leave!

## Slack Channels (#mentors and #help)

Make sure to join our Slack at [vandyhacksvi.slack.com](https://vandyhacksvi.slack.com), and keep notifications turned on for our event. This will be your main method of communicating with hackers and organizers. The #mentors channel is a private channel for discussions between mentors and organizers. Feel free to reach out here if you're unsure about anything! The #help channel is for any hacker to reach out requesting help from a mentor. Please keep an eye on this channel for anything you may be able to help out with!

If you have any additional questions or need to be added to the #mentor channel, please reach out to Gabriel Ting or Paavas Bhasin.

## [IMPORTANT] Mentorship Bot

### Introduction

- This year, we have a [Slackbot](https://app.slack.com/client/TPLEGCPGD/DPW0DHSDU) to help manage mentorship requests! It will live in [#help](https://app.slack.com/client/TPLEGCPGD/CPTME0AJU), [#mentors](https://app.slack.com/client/TPLEGCPGD/GPHQS9SHG), and in DMs.

###  Getting set up

- You can select &quot;Direct Messages&quot; in Slack, then [DM the Mentorship_slackbot](https://app.slack.com/client/TPLEGCPGD/DPW0DHSDU). Type in `!skills help` to see a list of skills that you can select, plus instructions on how to use it.

- Set your skills by typing `!skills` and then each skill, space delimited. After setting your skills, you should see the following:

### Claiming Requests

- In the `#mentors` private channel, you should see the requests from users come in.

![Sample request](./images/sample_request.png)

- You can then `Claim` the request, which changes the menu to either `Complete`, `Surrender`, or `Delete` the request. 
    - Please do not delete the request unless it is spam.
    - Surrender the request if you would like any other mentor to be able to claim it.

- Once a mentor claims a session, it will automatically put you in a DM channel with you and the mentorship requestor.

### Final Notes

- Thank you for being a mentor at VandyHacks VI! We're so excited to have you!

## Interacting With Hackers

This year, mentors will be wearing a different color shirt (purple) from the rest of the hackers, so you will be easier to spot. Please don’t feel confined to only assisting students who have asked for help on Slack. Many students who need help won’t ask on Slack because they feel like their problem is “too small to bother someone with” or “embarrassingly simple.” Usually, all it takes to get people to open up is approaching a team and saying “Hi, I’m [name]. Do you need help with anything?” Most people will respond with something like, “Well actually... do you know how to use the XYZ API?” or something similar. Even if the team doesn’t have any immediate problems, they will probably run into some later in the evening. Since you’ve already initiated a relationship with them, they will be less hesitant to reach out for help in the future. We’ll also have an area for mentors where hackers will be able to come ask for help.

## When Should You Be Here?

Please plan to be present at the times you signed up for. However, you’re not constrained to only be here at those times! In fact, we encourage you to stay as long as you like,  as this is a great opportunity to meet awesome hackers, see creative hacks in the works, and participate in fun activities.

Most students will spend Friday night thinking of their idea or mapping out their plan for the weekend. We’ll also be holding beginner workshops Friday night, so this is the time new hackers will have the most questions. In addition, if your company has a specific API you’d like to promote, this would be a great time to sell the students on its service. All throughout Saturday is when the bulk of the hacking happens, so it’s an excellent time for mentors to be present. Hackers will typically wake up around breakfast time and hack until 2-3am. Sunday morning consists of a rush to completion before the deadline. Most people need help during daylight hours (hackers need their sleep just like you do!), so don’t worry about burning the midnight oil if you don’t want to.

## WiFi

You can use our WiFi by connecting to the network with SSID “vummiv”. If you’re having trouble, check out [Vanderbilt's IT site](https://it.vanderbilt.edu/services/network/wireless/vu-guests.php) for troubleshooting, or contact an organizer.

## Eating

Free food and drink will be provided. If you have any dietary restrictions, please confirm with an organizer or volunteer before getting meals.

## Parking

Parking will be provided free of charge at the 25th Avenue Parking Garage located at 2461 Highland Ave, Nashville, TN 37212. Please use the Highland Avenue entrance, located along Highland Ave between 25th Ave S and 24th Ave S. Park in any non-reserved Zone 3 parking space.
