## tl;dr

First of all, thank you so much for dedicating your time to being a mentor! We want to ensure that our hackers get the best possible experience to create something amazing. Here are a few key points:

-   Join our Discord channel [here](https://discord.gg/zQk6v3t). All announcements will be made here, and you'll be connecting with students who may need help in the `#help` channel. To be given the mentor role on the server, follow the instructions in the `#role-selection` channel.

-   Have fun! For many of our hackers, this is their first introduction to the hacking culture, and if you’re having a blast, so will they! If there’s anything we can do for you or them, feel free to reach out by DMing an organizer.

-   In case of an emergency, please contact an organizer immediately.

## Discord

VandyHacks will be utilizing a Discord server to help organize our virtual hackathon. If you're new to Discord, we recommend [this guide](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360045138571-Beginner-s-Guide-to-Discord) to familiarize yourself with the application! We've also provided a few key points below.

### Key Points

-   Most of the hackers will post their questions in the `#help` channel. Feel free to respond in the channel by pinging the hacker in question.

-   We've also provided several voice/video rooms. Hop into one whenever you need to chat or show something to the hackers! During VandyHacks: Summer Edition, our mentors resolved many hacker questions in these rooms.

-   If you have private questions for the organizers or other fellow mentors, put them in the `#mentors-private` channel.

## Interacting With Hackers

This year, mentors and hackers will be given different roles on the server. To quickly check roles, click on the "Member List" button in the top-right corner of Discord. Please don’t feel confined to only assisting students who have asked for help in `#tickets`. Many students who need help won’t ask openly because they feel like their problem is “too small to bother someone with” or “embarrassingly simple.” If you find someone who might need some assistance, feel free to introduce yourself and strike up a conversation with them! As a mentor, you can refer people to the Mentorship Ticket Bot and continue to help them from there.

## When Should You Be Here?

Please plan to be present at the times you signed up for. However, you’re not constrained to only be here at those times! In fact, we encourage you to stay online as long as you like, as this is a great opportunity to meet awesome hackers, see creative hacks in the works, and participate in fun activities.

Most students will spend Friday night thinking of their idea or mapping out their plan for the weekend. We’ll also be holding beginner workshops Friday night, so this is the time new hackers will have the most questions. In addition, if your company has a specific API you’d like to promote, this would be a great time to sell the students on its service. All throughout Saturday is when the bulk of the hacking happens, so it’s an excellent time for mentors to be online. Hackers will typically wake up around breakfast time and hack until 2-3am. Sunday morning consists of a rush to completion before the deadline. Most people need help during daylight hours (hackers need their sleep just like you do!), so don’t worry about burning the midnight oil if you don’t want to.

## Final Notes

Thank you for being a mentor at VandyHacks VII. We're so excited to have you!
