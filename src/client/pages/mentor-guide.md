## tl;dr

First of all, thank you so much for dedicating your time to being a mentor! We want to ensure that our hackers get the best possible experience to create something amazing. Here are a few key points:

-   Join our Discord channel [here](https://discord.gg/zQk6v3t). All announcements will be made here, and you'll be connecting with students who may need help in the `#help` and `#tickets` channels. To be given the mentor role on the server, follow the instructions in the `#role-selection` channel.

-   Have fun! For many of our hackers, this is their first introduction to the hacking culture, and if you’re having a blast, so will they! If there’s anything we can do for you or them, feel free to reach out by DMing an organizer or opening a help ticket yourself.

-   In case of an emergency, please contact an organizer immediately.

## Discord

VandyHacks will be utilizing a Discord server to help organize our virtual hackathon. If you're new to Discord, we recommend [this guide](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360045138571-Beginner-s-Guide-to-Discord) to familiarize yourself with the application!

## Mentorship Ticket Bot

### Introduction

-   This year, we have a Mentorship Ticket Bot on our Discord server to help manage mentorship requests! It lives in every channel. Hackers can create help requests that will be visible to mentors in the `#tickets` channel.

### Getting Set Up

-   All help requests generated by the Mentorship Ticket Bot will reside in the `#tickets` channel. If you ever need a run-down of the bot's commands, type `!help` to see all available commands.

### Claiming Requests

-   In the `#tickets` channel, you will see a list of all currently open help requests. Each help request will already have its own channel created by the bot.

-   To enter a help request channel from `#tickets`, just click on the channel link provided in the ticket log.

-   Once inside the desired channel, type `!claim` to inform the hacker that you'll be helping them. You can also send a message in `#tickets` to inform other mentors that the request has been claimed.

### Closing Requests

-   Once you and the hacker both feel that the request has been resolved, you can type `!close` within the ticket channel to close and delete the request.
    -   <ins>IMPORTANT NOTE</ins>: Once a request has been closed and deleted, there is no way to retrieve the contents of the closed ticket channel. This deletion process is done to prevent channel spam within our server. <ins>Please let the hackers know when you decide to close a request. </ins> To preserve the contents of a request, ask the hacker to take screenshots or copy any relevant information.

## Interacting With Hackers

This year, mentors and hackers will be given different roles on the server. To quickly check roles, click on the "Member List" button in the top-right corner of Discord. Please don’t feel confined to only assisting students who have asked for help in `#tickets`. Many students who need help won’t ask openly because they feel like their problem is “too small to bother someone with” or “embarrassingly simple.” If you find someone who might need some assistance, feel free to introduce yourself and strike up a conversation with them! As a mentor, you can refer people to the Mentorship Ticket Bot and continue to help them from there.

## When Should You Be Here?

Please plan to be present at the times you signed up for. However, you’re not constrained to only be here at those times! In fact, we encourage you to stay online as long as you like, as this is a great opportunity to meet awesome hackers, see creative hacks in the works, and participate in fun activities.

Most students will spend Friday night thinking of their idea or mapping out their plan for the weekend. We’ll also be holding beginner workshops Friday night, so this is the time new hackers will have the most questions. In addition, if your company has a specific API you’d like to promote, this would be a great time to sell the students on its service. All throughout Saturday is when the bulk of the hacking happens, so it’s an excellent time for mentors to be online. Hackers will typically wake up around breakfast time and hack until 2-3am. Sunday morning consists of a rush to completion before the deadline. Most people need help during daylight hours (hackers need their sleep just like you do!), so don’t worry about burning the midnight oil if you don’t want to.

## Final Notes

Thank you for being a mentor at VandyHacks: Summer Edition. We're so excited to have you!
